# terraform_sandbox

This repository exists to try out various patterns and their trade-offs or challenges.

The examples in `examples/` all use [`null_resource`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/null/latest/docs/resources/resource).
Therefore, no actual remote resources (or state) should be created.
